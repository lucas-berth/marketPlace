Project started: March 30th 2024

Currently working:
My original thought was to have the contract transfer from the seller to buyer like a traditonal marketplace... 
But, the seller technically still has the contract in the terms of their debt and the buyer being a investor

In this case we would want to setup the contract to be duplicated to the Buyers inventory
